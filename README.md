 Python Library for Generalised Non-Negative Matrix Factorisiation (GNMF)


This Python library implements GNMF method introduced in article titled "Generalised Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation for Air Pollution Source Apportionment" published in the Science of Total Environment Journal.

Following are the details of the code,

$\min_{G,F} J = & \dfrac{1}{2}\left[(X_v - (GF)_v)^\intercal \Sigma_v^{-1}(X_v - (GF)_v)\right]$
