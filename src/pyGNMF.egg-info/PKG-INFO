# pyGNMF
 Python Library for Generalised Non-Negative Matrix Factorisiation (GNMF)

This Python library implements GNMF method introduced in article titled "Generalised Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation for Air Pollution Source Apportionment" published in the Science of Total Environment Journal.

Please refer to the article in SoftwareX for more details. 

## Some Features
Uses NumPy (or CuPy, if the package is installed) to factorise a matrix $X_{n\times m}$ into $G_{n\times p}$ and $F_{p\times m}$ with two user parameters.

### Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) should be of size $nm\times nm$ which captures element-wise covariance information. Depending on the type of covariance, GNMF method can act as different methods in the literature,
1. **Covariance Matrix as Identity**: In this case, GNMF method with multiplicative update is same as Lee and Seung's NMF method with multiplicative update. Projected gradient updates can also be used.
2. **Covariance Matrix is Diagonal Matrix**: In this case, GNMF method with multiplicative update is same as LS-NMF method discussed by Wang. Projected gradient updates can also be used.
3. **Covariance Matrix with elements correlated along rows or columns**: In this case, GNMF method with multiplicative update is same as glsNMF method discussed by Plis. Projected gradient updates can also be used.
4. **Covariance Matrix is Dense Matrix**: In this case, the GNMF Method with multiplicative and projected gradient method is as discussed in Lekinwala and Bhushan (2022).
